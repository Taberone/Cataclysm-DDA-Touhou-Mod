# Cataclysm-DDA-Touhou-Mod
Goes in data/mods.

Contains new professions based off of Touhou, a special scenario with the Touhou professions and less limits on where to start, and new clothing/weapons/profession traits/etc specifically made for certain professions. This mod is considered unfinished, but functional.

The latest version of Arcana Mod is recommended, since the Wicket Hermit starts with the Arcana skill. Playing without Arcana Mod will spawn an error about a missing skill, but it won't render the game unplayable.

Playing as a male survivor will only change the underwear (Boxers instead of panties) and nothing else (still wearing a dress/skirt/etc) at the moment. There is no compatibility with Chesthole or tilesets that actually display clothing and gear at the moment.

----------------------------------------------------------------
**New Professions:**

* **Phantom Swordswoman:** Close-range killing machine. Knows Niten Ichi-Ryu, and has a katana and wakizashi (can't dual-wield unfortunately). Anything that gets in range of her will die in a flurry of sword slashes, but anything with a gun will utterly ruin her day unless she learns how to use one.
* **Wicked Hermit:** Zombie Zlave master. Has the skills necessary to revive zombie corpses as loyal zlaves, knowledge of magic, and the ability to pass through walls via the Probability Travel CBM. Can easily build up an army of zombie zlaves. Befitting her lack of empathy, selfishness, and disrespect for the dead, she starts with the Psychopath trait. Starts with no weapons at the moment.
* **Lunatic Moon Rabbit:** Gunslinger. Proficient in the usage of all firearms and has a targeting Bionic to enhance her accuracy even further. Packs a unique, UPS-powered pistol that can fire in bursts, has a custom-made holster, has a Unified Power System CBM, and has the ability to shoot hostiles with her fingers.
* **Celestial Delinquent:** Made of iron. Resistant to pain and is tough enough to have natural armor. Carries a Sword of Hisou that takes up no space in her inventory until it is summoned into battle.
* **Chief Maid of the SDM:** Time-stopping, knife-throwing maid. Has several throwing knives, and a Time Dilation CBM.
* **Moon Rabbit Recruit:** Lunar Defense Corps Trainee and royal pet of the Watatsuki family. Not quite as proficent in the usage of firearms compared to the Lunatic Moon Rabbit. Has a teleportation CBM, a downgraded ability to shoot hostiles with her fingers, and a special Lunar Rifle with a shoulder strap and bayonet.
* **Oarfish Messenger:** Fancy fighter. Can whip people to death with her scarf and has electricity powers.
* **Hourai Incarnate:** Has fire powers. Starts with knowledge of Taekwondo (Since the attack descriptions are usually about kicking, which Mokou does in Urban Legend In Limbo), special talismans that help her resist flames, a Mini-Flamethrower CBM, and a Thermal Dissipation CBM. 
* **Lateral-Thinking Kappa:** WIP.

**New Weapons:**

* **Sword of Hisou:** A golden Jian that takes up no space until it is summoned into battle. Works similarly to an expandable baton.
* **Lunatic Pistol:** Burst-fire UPS pistol based off of Reisen Udongein Inaba's gun from Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom, the PS4 port of Urban Legend in Limbo, and Antinomy of Common Flowers. Does not turn into a shotgun at the moment, despite Reisen's gun having that ability in ULIL.
* **Lunar Rifle:** Standard-issue UPS-powered rifle of the Lunar Defense Corps that is far more efficient than a man-made one due to the power of Lunarian science. Comes with an integrated bayonet.

**New Bionics:**

* **Finger Burst CBM:** Shoot a five-round burst with your finger. Lunatic Moon Rabbit spawns with this.
* **Finger Gun CBM:** Shoot a real bullet with your finger. Downgraded version of Finger Burst. Moon Rabbit Recruit spawns with this.

**New Scenarios:**
* **Touhou:** All Touhou professions are playable. Greatly expanded range of starting locations, ranging from a FEMA camp to a gunstore to a LMOE shelter.

**New Monsters:**
* **Moon Rabbit:** WIP.
