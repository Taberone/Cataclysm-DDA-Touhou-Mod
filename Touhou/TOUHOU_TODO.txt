DONE SO FAR:
---------
Youmu Konpaku (Custom dress/accessory)

Seiga (Custom dress/accessory)

Reisen (Custom business suit, holsters, bionics, guns)

Tenshi (Custom mutation, dress, hat, sword)

---------
DON'T KNOW HOW/UNSURE HOW TO:
---------
Reisen's eye effect (No idea)

Acceptable stats for any clothing or weaponry added by this mod (Lots of copy/pastes with some stuff changed but it's still almost-identical)

"Balancing"/"Fun" (Some professions might feel too identical or just not fun to play, etc)

Seiga's hairstick cutting through walls

---------
MIGHT DO:
---------

Youmu's clothes divided into separate pieces instead of an all-in-one dress

Youmu gets her named weapons instead of the generic vanilla swords and either Niten is modded to include them too, or a new martial arts style that's Niten on steroids is added that includes them

Custom Sakuya knives? Knife throwing bionic?

Tenshi's sword works like the Expandable Baton (Can be expanded/collapsed to affect volume)
